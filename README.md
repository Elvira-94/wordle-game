# **Wordle++ - Project Portfolio 2 - Javascript**

Wordle++ is based on the popular New York Times online 5-letter word game. Wordle is a game of guessing words. Every day, you must guess a new word. You have six attempts, and each one provides some hints.

However, Wordle++ was created with customisation in mind as the user can easily change their mystery word count and even add more guesses! This gives the user a more fun and challenging way to play the game. How about guessing a mystery 3-letter word in 10 tries, how cool is that!
