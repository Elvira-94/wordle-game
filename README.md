# **Wordle++ - Project Portfolio 2 - Javascript**

Wordle++ is based on the popular New York Times online 5-letter word game. However, this Wordle was created with customisation in mind as the user can easily change their mystery word count and even add more guesses! This gives the user a more fun and challenging way to play the game. How about guessing a mystery 3-letter word in 10 tries, how cool is that!
